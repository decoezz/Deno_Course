Hello this is my tutorial for deno:

Learning this new backend language will be hard since there is no known courses so i will have to follow my heart and read the documentations and watch small videos on how to integrate certain things and build everything

in a similar fashion to it's ancestor node.js most of the work is handled in a modular way and folders and get all together in one file which in this case is called server.ts

we start by intializing our req and res by using the following code: async function handler(req:Request): Promise<Response>{const url = new URL(req.url) //getting the api url
    const path = url.pathname //getting url pathname
}

we can say that this function will handle all of our routes like the following:
if(req.method === 'GET' && path ==='/'){
        return new Response('hello world')       
}

so inside this handler function it will handle all of our routes and we can use the controllers inside of it


to intialize a deno http server we use the following command:
Deno.serve({port:PORT},handler)

the normal run command:deno run --allow-env-read --allow-net --allow-sys --env --watch server.ts

the new run command that does the same thing but is newer : deno -ERNS --env --watch server.ts


now we will learn how to implement mongodb inside deno.

we start by creating a new db.ts folder to handle the database

we import the Mongoclient and here we learn that deno doesn't use the idea of normal package.json no it uses the idea of importing directly from the source

if we get an error inside the improt from npm i think the solution is just calling the deno install command

deno has access to it's enviroment variables using: Deno.env

to exit deno if an error happens this is the code :Deno.exit(1);

i used npm here only because prettier is my main formatter i can't stand programming without adding a semi colon in the end of every line (maybe i need to go to therapy)

we intialize the new database using this code : const client = new MongoClient(MONGODB_URL);


we now connect to the data base using the following lines:
  await client.connect();
  await client.db('admin').command({ ping: 1 });
ping is used to make sure we can ping and connect to the database

what is so good in deno is that we have access to a lot of things in the database even more than node.js look for example at how we can get the collection :

const db = client.db(DB_NAME);
const todos = db.collection('todos');

now this todos variable will be a direct reference to the todos whole collection

now let's get to the functions/controller part:


all of our functions will have this body :
async function function_name(req:Request): Promise<Response> {
        const body = await req.json();
}
this body gives us access to the request as req and give us access to give response and now our req.body is called body

now let's focus on our REST functions

the add:     const result = await todos.insertOne(body);

we are adding a new instance to our todo collection called result

==========================================================================

I didn't write for a while for one reason i have been confused between what to use and what system i should follow and most of the confusion started at the idea of the Oak middleware which can be reduced to being called express in node.js.

Learning about all the things of Oak and how to make it work with native deno but it was worth the knowledge and the time.

So Oak essentially is like express in the idea of Router but it gets a little bit complicated since Oak doesn't work with the native deno request body so we need to adjust the request body and turn it into JSON so that we can handle it

I searched it and found no one actually did this and that was because Oak for some reason decided that the function that does this is no longer needed and they removed it

anyway i won't really explain how it handles the req.body you can already enter it and find all the documentation and comments inside it but anyway i will say one thing it's a little bit complicated since i need to make sure to handle request query also and handle certain requests

Now the point i'm at right now is that i'm going back a little bit to the root of deno which is TypeScript and try to refactor my code into OOP through classes and keeping every variable into it's type

I will achieve the last part using a validation library (like Joi in node) called Zod and will use another one of the OOP known methods/classes which is interface 

since i stopped for a while and while probably take a little bit of a break to work on some projects and other planned works i want to document something important and that is i disabled the deno extension since it caused a lot of problems with other typescript projects
        
        -the solution after disabling the deno extension is that i will detect the files automtically through the pressence of the deno.json file it will automtically identify a deno project
